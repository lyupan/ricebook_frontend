## API Design Decisions
In my design, the unique identifier for users is the username. To guarantee the username is unique, 
when new user registers for a user account, I make a query for the username. If the username already exists, refuses to insert into the database and tells the user to choose another name. 

As for the unique identifier for articles, an id generated by the backend is used. When a user posts a new article, I first search the database for the maximum id, and assgin (max + 1) as the id for the new article, then insert the article into the database.
